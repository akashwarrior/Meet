# Remote-Connection
This repo contains backend and frontend in seperate folder backend have websocket connections using socket.io and frontend have react js using vite and front looks for localhost at port 3000 to connect with server and both screen reciever and sender have to connect with backend server in order to get connected


rd-share is also similar version of screen sharing but with improved and better UI and without needed of websocke because that part handled by firebase cloud firestore and also this time login is neccessay to access the website so firestore stay less load of annonymous users.
